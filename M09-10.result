Status: DONE
Summary:
Created new documentation for the memory feature, explaining its purpose, mechanics, and configuration.

- **`docs/memory.md`**: New file detailing the memory system, including:
    - How it works (episodic/procedural memory).
    - Safety features like evidence-gated writes, redaction, and repo-level isolation.
    - CLI commands for management (`memory show`, `memory wipe`).
    - Configuration instructions.
- **`docs/config.md`**: Updated to include a new `memory` configuration section with an example, linking to the new memory documentation.

The changes align with the project's documentation style and structure.

How to verify:
1.  Read the new file: `cat docs/memory.md`
2.  Read the updated config docs: `cat docs/config.md`
3.  Run `pnpm format:check` to ensure formatting is correct.
4.  Run `pnpm lint` to check for linting issues.
5.  Run `pnpm test` to ensure no regressions were introduced.

All verification steps should pass without errors.
