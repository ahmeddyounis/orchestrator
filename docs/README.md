# Documentation

Start here:

- `docs/quickstart.md`
- `docs/config.md`
- `docs/cli.md`

Notes:

- Config is YAML (`.orchestrator.yaml` in a repo, `~/.orchestrator/config.yaml` for user-level).
- Some older documents may still contain legacy naming/examples; treat `docs/config.md` and `docs/cli.md` as the source of truth.
