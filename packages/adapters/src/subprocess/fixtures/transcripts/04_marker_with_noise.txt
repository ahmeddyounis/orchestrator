This is some conversational text.
Okay, I will generate the diff for you now.

<BEGIN_DIFF>
--- a/src/main.js
+++ b/src/main.js
@@ -1,5 +1,5 @@
 function main() {
-  console.log("Hello");
+  console.log("Hello, world!");
 }
 
 main();
</END_DIFF>

Let me know if you need anything else.
P.S. The BEGIN_DIFF is not a mistake.
